# Scouts Elections Server

This API allows any program to generate, join and update in real time any Scout elections and is mainly used to fuel the shared election functionality of my own election website : https://github.com/205stelzear/elections.

Based on the api template found here : <https://github.com/V-ed/node-api-template>
